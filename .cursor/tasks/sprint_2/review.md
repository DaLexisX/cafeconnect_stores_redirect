# Sprint 2 Review

- [x] Verify `step_1.md` is done.
- [x] Verify `step_2.md` is done.
- [x] Confirm the `pages.yml` workflow file has been updated correctly with newer action versions.
- [x] Summarize the changes made.

**Summary:** Updated GitHub Actions in `.github/workflows/pages.yml` based on the provided information. Changed `actions/upload-pages-artifact` to `@v3` and `checkout`, `configure-pages`, `deploy-pages` to `@v4`. This should resolve the error caused by the internal dependency on the deprecated `actions/upload-artifact@v3`.
