# Sprint 1 Review

- [x] Verify `step_1.md` is done.
- [x] Verify `step_2.md` is done.
- [x] Confirm the workflow file has been updated correctly. (No update needed)
- [x] Summarize the changes made.

**Summary:** Investigated GitHub Actions error `Error: Missing download info for actions/upload-artifact@v3`. Found the relevant workflow file (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`) but confirmed it does *not* use `actions/upload-artifact@v3`. It uses `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2` instead. No code changes were made. The error message may be outdated or originate elsewhere. Recommend re-running the workflow.
