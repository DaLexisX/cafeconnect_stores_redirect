# Task 1: Locate Workflow File

- [x] Find the GitHub Actions workflow file(s) in the `.github/workflows` directory. (`pages.yml`)
- [x] Identify the line(s) using `actions/upload-artifact@v3`.

**Note:** The action `actions/upload-artifact@v3` was *not* found in `pages.yml`. The workflow uses `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2` instead. The error message might be outdated or refer to something else.
